            <div class="col-5"><p>Electric vehicles or gasoline vehicles? There is much debate over what is the better option. With pros and cons for either side, it can be pretty tough to find a car that provides the most benefits. Electric cars have become more prevalent every year, therefore, the cons for electric vehicles have started to go down. For example, many years ago, the concern with electric vehicles was that the concept was too niche because primarily Tesla dominated the market. However in today’s reality, over 40 different companies now produce models of electric vehicles, whether that be all-electric or hybrid. Furthermore, electric cars are a lot more widespread than they once were. The bar graph titled “Model Year of EVs Bought in the State of WSH”, shows that as newer versions come out, more people are buying.</p>

            <div class="col"><p>In Washington, nearly 60,000 EVs from last year (2023) were purchased. That total number is over double what it was two years ago (2022). As of right now, this year is projected to be right around 30,000 EVs sold from the year 2024 (that’s if the trend continues exactly how it is). However, this number does not take into account the two big seasons for car buying amongst consumers which is March through the end of May and then from September into November. With all of this in mind, the electric car buying industry continues to be less of the minority as more consumers start purchasing these types of vehicles. And as more people buy these vehicles, less cons arise because there is less of an unknown and more of a market to sell electric car services (charging ports at gas stations, specialized towing for electric vehicles, etc.). 
            </p></div><p>Lindsey Schneider is the owner of Smail Auto Group in a town just outside of Pittsburgh, PA. Smail Auto works with several car manufacturers including Mercedes, Honda, Acura, Ford, and more. With car manufacturers coming out with more EVs every year, Scheider and her dealerships work with these kinds of cars every day. Schneider says that with the increase in services geared towards electric vehicles, more people will start purchasing those types of cars.
            </p><p>“If there were more charging stations, more people would be less scared to buy. But most people have what’s called ‘range anxiety’. This is when someone has to travel a long distance somewhere with their electric car and not know where or if there is a charging station along the way. And some electric vehicles take almost an hour to charge. If you manage to find a charging station, you could end up waiting in a line and then have to wait even longer to charge your car.” 
            </p><p>In the state of New York, more and more charging stations for electric vehicles have begun to sprout. The chart below details the amount of charging stations in New York from the year 2010 to present. However, Schneider says that increasing the number of charging ports is easier said than done for some states/areas.
            </p><p>“We don't have a grid to support it,” Schneider explained about the potential for more charging stations in western Pennsylvania. “So we don't have enough power and electricity to charge all these cars and put all these charging stations in.”
            </p><p>With this in mind, electric pumps have been a slow addition to many gas stations. Just because there are more electric cars being bought and produced, does not mean all the logistics are fully thought out. Electric companies that work with state and local governments have to make sure that there is enough electricity/power supply in order to support these pumps. So, the graph below shows that the number of charging pumps at gas stations have increased in New York, but it’s been a gradual change. 
            </p><p>Now that some of the information has been laid out, what are the benefits to switching from a gasoline-powered to an electric-powered vehicle? Is the time to buy an electric vehicle now? Schneider says that everyone is different with how they feel about their EVs, but she thinks some people have jumped the gun when it comes to making the switch from gas to electric. However, that’s not to say that there won’t be a day to make that switch. 
            </p><p>“We have seen, as a dealership, that those that have purchased electric vehicles from us have already traded them back in for gasoline-powered vehicles. There have been too many things still left to be ironed out with electric cars, especially with the range anxiety. Another issue is there is still a concern about what dealerships and service shops are supposed to do with an old battery. You can’t just dispose of it. With all this being said, I do think electric cars are here to stay and will only continue to get better. But I think the carriage was put before the horse just with all of the things left to figure out.”
            </p><p>With still a lot to apparently unpack when it comes to electric cars, there is still a growing demand for EVs across the country. As technology continues to develop and electric cars become even more of the known than the unknown, more people will be willing to make the switch from gas to electric.
